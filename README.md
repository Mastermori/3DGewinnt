# 3DGewinnt
This is just a fun little project I worked on for school.
It's like tic tac toe but in 3D space, so you have another axis to worry about.

It is best play with 3 or more people (since you can change the size of the cube, 
the length of a row to win and the players playing) but it is possible to play with just two people. As soon as the player who goes first
figured the game out, however, he can easily win 100% of the time (assuming a 3x3x3 cube with a win-length of 3)


Features:
- Displays for 3D as well as 2D map of the selected layer (switch through layers with -/Q and +/E)
- Sizes can be changed (e.g. 5x5x5 playing field with a win-length of 5)
- Numpad can be used to place marks in 3x3 space
- 3D visualisation can be fully moved to enable optimal view (WASD to rotate, Arrow keys to move, "." and "," to zoom in and out)

Currently the game is only customizable from the command line when creating a server for online play.
This will be changed in the next update and you will get a prompt at the start of the game to customize it.
